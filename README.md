# Market_Basket_Analysis

# Objective
The objective of the market basket analysis was to identify patterns and relationships in customer purchasing behavior.

# Methodology
1. Data Collection: Market basket data was collected, containing information on customer transactions, including items purchased and quantity.
2. Data Preprocessing: The data was preprocessed to create a binary matrix, where each row represented a transaction and each column represented an item.
3. Apriori Algorithm: The Apriori algorithm was applied to the preprocessed data to generate frequent itemsets, which are sets of items that appear together in a transaction.
4. Association Rules: Association rules were generated from the frequent itemsets, which describe the probability of an item being purchased given that another item has been purchased.

# Insights
1. Frequent Itemsets: The analysis identified frequent itemsets, which indicate items that are often purchased together.
2. Association Rules: The analysis generated association rules, which provide insights into the relationships between items and the probability of an item being purchased given that another item has been purchased.
3. Customer Behavior: The analysis provided insights into customer purchasing behavior, including the items that are most frequently purchased together.
